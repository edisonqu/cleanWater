# cleanWater
CleanWater is the first functional game and project that was made.

The user chooses 4 materials to create a good water filter.

Upon pressing GO, there the user gets a score from the program telling the user how effective the water was.

The game was developed as the Culmulating Performance Task for Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science Class and was submitted for a video game contest.

Although it was not the most fun game, it was definitely fun to work on.

Made in 2021/03/31.
